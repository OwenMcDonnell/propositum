#+Title: propositum

** Background
Propositum is a collection of free and open-source, portable tools to facilitate task & information management, automation, data manipulation and analytics.

The rationale for creating propositum, and maintaining in a GitHub repo, was to be able to quickly get up-and-running with the required tools + my own customisations, particularly those machines with severely restricted access to obtain external software.

** Components
Propositum consists of:

- [[http://cmder.net/][Cmder]] a console emulator & cmd replacement  
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]] & [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] ([[http://spacemacs.org/][=spacemacs=]] flavour) for task & information management
- [[https://www.knime.com/knime-analytics-platform][KNIME Analytics Platform]] for data pipelines, transformation, automation & reporting
- [[https://superset.incubator.apache.org/][Apache Superset]] for data exploration, dashboards & data visualisation
 - Running in a =virtualenv= under [[https://winpython.github.io/][WinPython]] (=Zero= flavour), a portable Python runtime
- [[http://rawgraphs.io/][RAWGraphs]] for additional data visualisation options (and an quick-and-easy interface)
 - Running with the standard =python3= HTTP server under WinPython
- [[https://autohotkey.com/][AutoHotKey]] for general Windows automation 
-  Customisations for each of these tools & separating user data
-  A number of helper scripts to launch applications & maintain portability

** Installation


=git clone https://github.com/xeijin/propositum <folder to clone into>=

Or if Git is prohibited, simply download the repository as a ZIP archive from the [[https://github.com/xeijin/propositum][GitHub page]].

*Note:* Whilst portability has been maintained as much as possible, some components (notably =virtualenv=) aren't designed with 'live' portability in-mind.

For best results it is strongly recommended that you use the =subst= command on windows to map the cloned/downloaded repository to the drive letter =P:=

Example:

=subst P: C:/Propositum/Location=

You will find symlinks to all of the key components in the root directory, user files & customisations are stored in /home

** License & Source

Given the 'in-place' nature of the distribution of its repository, source code has not been included to decrease the download size & reduce complexity, but please see below for a summary and links to pertinent information.
