#+Title: propositum

Propositum is a collection of free and open-source, portable components to facilitate task & information management, automation, data manipulation and analytics.

The rationale for creating propositum, and maintaining in a Git repo, was to be able to quickly get up-and-running with the required tools + any customisations, particularly those machines in organisations with severely restricted access to obtain external software.

** Installation

1. Download and un-archive the latest =release= using 7-Zip to a folder of your choice.

2. Mount to the drive letter =P:= on Windows using the =subst= command[fn:1], example:

   =subst P: C:/Propositum/Location=

3. You will find symlinks to all of the key components in the root directory which you can use to launch applications. User files & customisations are stored in =./home=

[fn:1] Whilst portability has been maintained as much as possible, some components (notably =virtualenv=) aren't designed with 'live' portability in-mind, hence the workaround using =subst= above.

** Components, Intended Usage, Licenses & Sources

- Releases are compiled by an orchestration script (see =./config/propositum-build.ps1=), mostly using a number of components' release binaries, and run on a cloud-hosted continuous integration platform which delivers the final release to GitHub.

- For this reason the source code has not been included in the repository, but please see below for a summary of the components, usage, licenses and links to sources.

- The *GNU GPL v3* license is applied to this repository overall, given its compatibility with the licenses listed (inferred from [[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses][this page on the GNU website]]) this is primarily driven by necessity (the internal software approval mechanisms of many organisations support only one license per download file).

Customised configuration files for all of these tools are also included, as are a number of 'helper' scripts (mainly batch files) to ensure the applications can run correctly & consistently across deployments.
